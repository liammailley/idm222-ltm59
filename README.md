# IDM 222 - Portfolio

Current classes/objects to keep aware of:
.iglogo (instagram logo link)
.lilogo (linkedin logo link)
.ghlogo (github logo link)
.bigbold (the big name at the top of the page)
.bigbold-sub (the thing under my big name)

General goals:
- remove ugly taskbar and make the top heading one seamless sticky bit
    - this means moving home/work/resume to the top (NOT A POPOUT MENU!! OVERDONE)
- Add a bio to home page
    - And some actual pictures of myself
- Update the stuff I have on my Work page
- Different font!! At least for copy. Especially on titles of Work page... looks childish

TO DO:

The nav bar needs a single class. Use flexbox to get HOME, WORK and RESUME on one line, preferably next to the Big Bold.
And if that's the case, flexbox the Big Bold as well, and the Big Bold sub.

RESPONSIVE IMAGES ON HOME PORTRAIT!!! Do we want this thing to fill the screen on desktop like it's been doing?
I'm thinking better choice would be to have it fill screen on phone and even tablet. But on desktop, 
have it be off to the side and have bio text start next to it.

Get home page done, we'll worry about the other pages once we have this foundation down.
