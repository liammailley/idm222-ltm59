Current classes/objects to keep aware of:
.iglogo (instagram logo link)
.lilogo (linkedin logo link)
.ghlogo (github logo link)
.bigbold (the big name at the top of the page)
.bigbold-sub (the thing under my big name)

General goals:

- all images need alt tags
- ALL IMAGES NEED ALT TAGS
- RUN THRU THE w3C VALIDATIONS

TO DO:

Finish the 4 work pages.

### BEST PRACTICES:

file names: all lowercase, no spaces no special characters
coding styles: use white space. indent properly. indent nested things. put each CSS rule on its own line. USE COMMENTS.

functionality: everything needs to work. IMAGES NEEEED TO BE WEBP OR RESIZED TO EXACT SIZE. ADD ANIMATIONS AND TRANSITIONS TO LINKS.

design: text contrast. look at spacing, typography, measure, leading, etc. We also need inclusive design.
